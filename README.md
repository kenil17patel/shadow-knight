-> Batman will look for the hostages on a given building by jumping from one window to another using his grapnel gun. Batman's goal is to jump to the window where the hostages are located in order to disarm the bombs. Unfortunately he has a limited number of jumps before the bombs go off...

-> Before each jump, the heat-signature device will provide Batman with the direction of the bombs based on Batman current position:
    U (Up)
    UR (Up-Right)
    R (Right)
    DR (Down-Right)
    D (Down)
    DL (Down-Left)
    L (Left)
    UL (Up-Left

-> Aim for this code practice is to implement BinarySerch algorithm in 2-dimension array with c++ language.
